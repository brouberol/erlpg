Side project with which I'm trying to

* teach myself Erlang
* learn rules of a Dungeon-and-Dragons-like Role Playing Game called [Chroniques Oubli√©es](http://chroniques-mondesoublies.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bienvenue_dans_Les_Chroniques_des_Mondes_Oubli%C3%A9s), in order to become a Dungeon Master

I'm thus implementing the *basic* rules of character creation, combat, etc, in order to better remember them AND teach myself Erlang in the process.
